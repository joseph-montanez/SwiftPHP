# Performance

Swift offers great performance since its a compiled language with parallel and async features that are type checked. All while having no garbage collection.

## Benchmark Pairwise Distance

Pairwise Distance calculates the distance between every unique pair of vectors

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$$

### Result

| Version                   | Vector Count | Pairwise Calculations | Execution Time | Estimated Time at 50k Vectors   | Speedup                |
| :------------------------ | :----------- | :-------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **PHP** (Baseline)        | 2,000        | ~2 Million            | ~1.47 s        | **~15.3 minutes***              | 1x                     |

### PHP Benchmark Test

```php
$numVectors = 50_000;

echo "Generating test data...\n";
$vectors = [];
for ($i = 0; $i < $numVectors; $i++) {
    $vectors[] = new \raylib\Vector3(
        rand(0, 100) / 10.0,
        rand(0, 100) / 10.0,
        rand(0, 100) / 10.0
    );
}
echo "Test data generated.\n\n";



$smallVectorSet = array_slice($vectors, 0, 2000);

printf("\n--- Benchmarking Pairwise Distance ---\n");
printf("Running PHP version with %s vectors...\n", number_format(count($smallVectorSet)));
$startPhp = microtime(true);
$phpDistance = php_total_pairwise_distance($smallVectorSet);
$endPhp = microtime(true);
$phpTime = $endPhp - $startPhp;
printf("PHP Time: %.4f seconds\n", $phpTime);


printf("\nRunning Swift version with %s vectors...\n", number_format(count($vectors)));
$startSwift = microtime(true);
$swiftDistance = \raylib\total_pairwise_distance($vectors); // Your new namespaced function
$endSwift = microtime(true);
$swiftTime = $endSwift - $startSwift;
printf("Swift Time: %.4f seconds\n", $swiftTime);

$speedup = ($phpTime / count($smallVectorSet)**2) / ($swiftTime / count($vectors)**2);
printf("\nâœ… Swift extension is roughly %.2f times faster on a per-operation basis.\n", $speedup);
```

### Pure PHP Implementation
PHP has no built-in threading or parallel features to speed this up.
```php
/**
 * Calculates the sum of the distances between every unique 
 * pair of vectors in the array. This is an O(n^2) operation.
 */
function php_total_pairwise_distance(array $vectors): float
{
    $totalDistance = 0.0;
    $count = count($vectors);

    for ($i = 0; $i < $count; $i++) {
        for ($j = $i + 1; $j < $count; $j++) {
            $dx = $vectors[$i]->x - $vectors[$j]->x;
            $dy = $vectors[$i]->y - $vectors[$j]->y;
            $dz = $vectors[$i]->z - $vectors[$j]->z;
            $totalDistance += sqrt($dx * $dx + $dy * $dy + $dz * $dz);
        }
    }

    return $totalDistance;
}
```

### SwiftPHP Native PHP Extension Implementation
```swift
/**
 * A simple, thread-safe container to hold a single value.
 *
 * Why a class?
 * A class is a reference type, so we can pass an instance of it into a concurrent
 * Task and have that task modify the original object's contents.
 *
 * Why final?
 * `final` tells the compiler that this class will never be subclassed. This is a
 * performance optimization, as it allows the compiler to use direct function
 * calls (static dispatch) instead of more complex dynamic dispatch.
 *
 * Why generic (`<T>`)?
 * This makes the box reusable. It can hold any type of value (a Double,
 * a String, a custom struct, etc.), not just the Double needed for this specific function.
 *
 * Why `@unchecked Sendable`?
 * `Sendable` is a protocol that marks a type as being safe to share across
 * concurrent threads. Classes are not `Sendable` by default because they represent
 * shared, mutable state, which is a primary source of data races.
 * `@unchecked` is a promise to the compiler: "I, the developer, guarantee that
 * I have made this class thread-safe myself." The compiler will then trust us
 * and allow this object to be passed into a concurrent `Task`.
 */
final class ResultBox<T>: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// The value being stored. It's private to ensure all access goes
    /// through our thread-safe `get()` and `set()` methods. It's an optional
    /// because it starts with no value.
    private var value: T?
    
    /// The locking mechanism. `NSLock` is a basic mutex (mutal exclusion lock).
    /// It ensures that only one thread can be executing the code inside the
    /// locked section at any given time, preventing data races.
    private let lock = NSLock()

    /**
     * Safely sets the value from any thread.
     */
    func set(_ value: T) {
        // Acquire the lock. If another thread already holds the lock, this
        // line will pause and wait until the lock is released.
        lock.lock()
        
        // `defer` is a powerful Swift feature. The code inside the `defer` block
        // is guaranteed to run at the end of the current scope (i.e., just
        // before the `set` function returns), no matter what happens. This
        // ensures the lock is *always* released, even if an error occurred.
        defer { lock.unlock() }
        
        // Now that we have the lock, it's safe to modify the shared value.
        self.value = value

    }
}

/**
 * Calculates the total pairwise distance in parallel.
 *
 * Why `async`?
 * This marks the function as asynchronous. It can perform long-running, concurrent
 * work without blocking the thread that calls it. The `await` keyword is used
 * to call it, which allows the system to suspend this function and run other
 * code while waiting for the parallel tasks to complete.

    // It ensures that all vectors are processed.
    let chunkSize = (count + processorCount - 1) / processorCount

    // Why `withTaskGroup`?
    // This is the primary tool in Swift for dynamic, structured concurrency. It

            // thread, typically from a cooperative thread pool sized to the

        // Why `for await`?

    // 1. PERFORMANCE: Accessing data from PHP objects is slow and involves API

    //    of magnitude faster.
    // 2. THREAD SAFETY: PHP's internal data structures are NOT safe to be
    //    accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Copying the data creates
    //    a safe, isolated snapshot that our parallel Swift code can work on
    //    without risk of crashing or corrupting the PHP engine.

    // times as elements are appended.

    // synchronous C-style function.
